# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'valueOf')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error and its solution. The error occurs when attempting to compare a variable to 'null' before handling the case when that variable is 'undefined'.

## Bug
The original code contains a logic error where a comparison of the input with null is made. However, it doesn't handle the scenario where the input variable is undefined. This results in a TypeError when the code attempts to perform an operation (such as the valueOf method) on an undefined value.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly checking for both null and undefined values before making further comparisons.
